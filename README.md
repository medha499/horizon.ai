## Horizon.AI â€“ Voice of Customer (VoC) Analytics Platform
* Engineered scalable pipelines for 250K+ multilingual feedback records/month using Airflow, Kafka, Spark, Snowflake, and MongoDB}, supporting both streaming and batch workflows.
* Built a hybrid classifier with proprietary models, OpenAI, and LLaMA2} combined with TF-IDF/KMeans + logistic regression}, achieving F1 = 0.87 across 18 feedback themes.
* Enhanced accuracy with \textbf{active learning + vector search} (Sentence-Transformers + FAISS), improving minority-class F1 by +11 pts and enabling root-cause retrieval at <200ms latency.
* Delivered a Streamlit insights app with drilldowns, trends, and cost-to-impact scoring, enabling CX/Product teams to triage issues \textbf{35\% faster} and improve NPS interventions by  28%.
* Optimized cost and performance by 41% via cascaded inference (small models first, LLM fallback), parquet compaction, and Snowflake auto-suspend policies.
